An Automatic Timetable Generator is a software application designed to automatically create and manage timetables for schools, colleges, or universities. It eliminates the manual, time-consuming, and error-prone process of scheduling classes by intelligently assigning time slots, teachers, subjects, and classrooms based on constraints and requirements.

üß† Core Features
Automated Schedule Generation
Uses optimization algorithms to allocate:

      Teachers to subjects

      Subjects to classes

      Rooms and time slots
      All while avoiding conflicts and adhering to constraints.
      
      Custom Constraints Management
      
      Teacher availability (free periods)

      Preferred teaching slots
      
      Room capacity and lab requirements
      
      Maximum number of periods per day
      
      No class repetition in the same day
      
      Multi-user Role System
      
      Admin: Adds teachers, subjects, and sets constraints
      
      Teachers: View and update their schedules
      
      Students: Access class-wise timetables
      
      Editable Timetables

      Manual changes allowed post-generation
      
      Drag-and-drop feature for slot adjustments
      
      Conflict Detection & Resolution
      
      Detects clashes like double bookings
      
      Suggests alternative slots or auto-resolves
      
      Report Generation
      
      PDF/Excel exports of final timetables
      
      Printable class-wise and teacher-wise schedules

      User Interface
      
      Web or desktop-based interface
      
      Easy navigation through days, periods, and classes
      
      ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Functionality Flow)
      Input Phase

Admin inputs:

      Classes (e.g., 1st Year IT, 2nd Year CSE)
      
      Teachers and their subjects
      
      Subject credit hours/week
      
      Lab vs Theory classes
      
      Room availability
      
      Constraints (teacher leaves, breaks, room types)
      
      Processing Phase

      The algorithm (e.g., Genetic Algorithm, Backtracking, Constraint Satisfaction Problem [CSP]) processes all data
      
      Generates optimal combinations minimizing idle periods and avoiding conflicts
      
      Output Phase

Generates:

      Class-wise timetable
      
      Teacher-wise timetable
      
      Room-wise timetable
      
      College Timetable Generation:
      
      Department: Information Technology
      
      Classes: IT-I, IT-II, IT-III
      
      Subjects: DBMS, OS, Java, Python, SE
      
      Teachers: 10 faculty members

Constraints:

      Each class must have at least 2 lab sessions/week
      
      No teacher has more than 3 consecutive lectures

Rooms:       


      5 theory + 2 labs

Output: 


      5-day weekly timetable auto-generated for all classes with no conflicts.
